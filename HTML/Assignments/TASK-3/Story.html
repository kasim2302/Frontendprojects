                <p>I’m Mohamed Kasim from Chennai, India, and I completed my B.Tech in Information Technology from Aalim
                    Muhammed Salegh College of Engineering. From my college days, I’ve been passionate about technology
                    and curious to explore how things work. I learned different programming languages, built small
                    projects, and faced many challenges, but each one taught me valuable lessons. For me, technology is
                    not just about coding-it’s about solving problems. My struggles shaped me into someone who doesn’t
                    give up easily. I enjoy learning, experimenting with tools, and building solutions, and I’m excited
                    to keep growing in the field of technology.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I completed my B.Tech in Information Technology at Aalim Muhammed Salegh College of Engineering, Chennai. I gained
                technical skills in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Django, and ReactJS. I worked on projects like an e-commerce
                web application, a user profile management system, and an email validation website, which strengthened my knowledge
                in full-stack development and problem-solving.</p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>I have strong skills in HTML, including creating structured web pages with proper use of semantic tags, hyperlinks,
                lists, tables, and multimedia integration. I can design forms with various input types and attributes, ensuring
                accessibility and responsiveness. My HTML knowledge forms the foundation for building clean, user-friendly, and
                well-structured websites.</p>

            <p>I have completed projects including a User Profile Management System, an E-commerce Web Application, and an Email
                Validation and Bulk Email Sending Website. These projects helped me apply my knowledge of Python, Django, HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, SQL, and ReactJS. Through them, I gained experience in full-stack development, database handling, user
                authentication, and creating functional, user-friendly web applications.</p>
