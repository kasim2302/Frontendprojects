    <h1>My Story in Tech</h1>
    <p class="story">
       I’m Mohamed Kasim from Chennai, India. I completed my B.Tech in Information Technology from Aalim Muhammed Salegh College of Engineering.

Right from my college days, I have been passionate about technology and curious to explore how things work. I studied different programming languages during my graduation and tried to build small projects to apply what I learned. It wasn’t always easy – I faced a lot of challenges while learning. Sometimes errors felt never-ending, sometimes projects didn’t work the way I expected, and many times I had to start over from scratch.

But all those struggles taught me something important: technology is not just about writing code, it’s about solving problems. Every difficulty became a lesson, and every challenge made me stronger. I never saw failure as the end, instead, I used it as a way to improve myself.

My passion for tech keeps me motivated to learn new things and grow every day. I enjoy building solutions, experimenting with different tools, and creating something useful out of my knowledge. The challenges I faced shaped me into someone who doesn’t give up easily, and I’m excited to continue this journey of learning and building in the field of technology.
