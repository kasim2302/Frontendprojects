🔹 Difference between HTML Web Pages and React Web Pages
Feature	HTML Web Page	React Web Page
Structure	Static and built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.	Dynamic, built using React components (JSX).
Rendering	Page reloads for every change.	Uses Virtual DOM – updates only changed parts without reloading.
Reusability	No component reusability.	Reusable components for UI building.
Performance	Slower for frequent updates.	Faster due to Virtual DOM and one-time rendering.
Data Handling	No state management.	Has state and props for managing data dynamically.
🔹 Difference between React and Angular
Feature	React	Angular
Type	Library for UI	Full-fledged Framework
Language	JavaScript (with JSX)	TypeScript
Data Binding	One-way data binding	Two-way data binding
Learning Curve	Easier	Comparatively harder
DOM	Virtual DOM	Real DOM
Performance	Faster rendering	Slightly slower due to real DOM
Used For	Building UI components	Complete application development
🔹 What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
It helps detect errors during development and makes large projects more maintainable.
👉 Example:

let name: string = "Kasim";


Here, TypeScript ensures name must always be a string.

🔹 What is a Variable?

A variable is a container used to store data in a program.
Example:

let age = 25;

🔹 What is Declaration?

Declaration is when you create a variable name without assigning a value.
Example:

let age;

🔹 What is Initialization?

Initialization means assigning an initial value to a declared variable.
Example:

let age = 25;

🔹 What is Lexical Scope?

Lexical scope means the scope is determined by where the variable is written in the code.
Inner functions can access variables defined in their outer functions.
Example:

function outer() {
  let a = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(a); // accessible
  }
  inner();
}

🔹 What is Block Scope?

Block scope restricts variables declared inside {} to that block only.
Example:

{
  let x = 10;
}
console.log(x); // ❌ Error – x not accessible

🔹 What is Functional Scope?

Variables declared inside a function are accessible only within that function.
Example:

function test() {
  var y = 20;
}
console.log(y); // ❌ Error – y not accessible

🔹 What is Hoisting?

Hoisting means JavaScript moves declarations to the top of the scope before executing code.
Example:

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;


Here, the declaration of a is hoisted but not its value.

🔹 What are Closures?

A closure is when a function remembers variables from its outer scope even after that outer function has finished executing.
Example:

function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    return count;
  }
}
const counter = outer();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2

🔹 In Web Development, Why Node.js Came

Node.js was created to run JavaScript on the server-side, not just in browsers.
It allows:

Building backend APIs using JS.

Handling multiple requests efficiently (non-blocking I/O).

Full-stack development using one language (JavaScript).

🔹 Which One Came First

HTML came first → for structuring web pages.

JavaScript came next → for adding interactivity.

Node.js came later → to use JS on the server-side.

React and Angular came afterward → for building modern web apps.
