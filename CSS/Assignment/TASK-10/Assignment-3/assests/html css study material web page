HTML Introduction & Basics

What is HTML?
HTML is a markup language used to structure web pages. It is not a programming language but a set of elements and tags that tell the browser how to display content.

Tags in HTML

Opening Tags: Written as <tagname>. Example: <p> starts a paragraph.

Closing Tags: Written as </tagname>. Example: </p> ends a paragraph.

Self-Closing Tags: Tags that don’t need a closing part. Example: <br /> adds a line break, <img /> inserts an image.

2. HTML Elements

Block-Level Elements

Always start on a new line and take up the full width.

Examples: <div>, <p>, <section>, <header>, <footer>.

Use Case: Grouping sections, paragraphs, articles.

Inline Elements

Do not start on a new line; only take up as much space as needed.

Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>.

Use Case: Styling specific words, creating links.

Semantic Elements

Provide meaning to the content, not just structure.

Examples: <header>, <main>, <article>, <aside>, <nav>.

Use Case: Better SEO, accessibility, and readability.

✅ This content is enough for a detailed single-page project. You can split it into sections with navigation links and maybe add examples or diagrams for extra marks.

Would you like me to now create a visual page flow (like a sitemap or wireframe) to show how each section can be arranged on the web page?
